# EEL3111C_Manual
This repository contains the latex for UF's circuits 1 laboratory manual.

To use: 
1.) Download TeXworks to your device. It is a development environment for LaTeX that will work. https://miktex.org/download This link will download the MikTex distribution, which provides the full support needed for Texworks to work correctly.
2.) Download the the other repository to your device. This contains all the files needed.
3.) Open TeXworks. Navigate to File -> Open -> Wherever you copied the folder from step two to.
4.) Open "EEL 311C Lab Manual.tex" You can open other tex files, but this is the only one that will "run"

NOTE: "EEL 311C Lab Manual.tex" is essentially a connecting document that links all of the other tex
files that make up the lab manual (seen as \include{lab1} etc..).

To make edits:
1.) Open the respective tex file you would like to modify (ex. open lab3.tex from the f
older in teXworks)
2.) Make changes to the file as needed, and save it.
3.) Now open "EEL 311C Lab Manual.tex" and press the green arrow in the top left of the screen.
This will recompile the full document and generate a pdf of the manual where you can see the new changes.
4.) Save this pdf to your device. You now have an updated manual!

Please push all changes to the repository so they can be tracked and ensure we always have the most up to date manual!
